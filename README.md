# watch-and-learn-LfD-controller
Data and simulation files (coming soon) for learning control from expert demonstrations

The data was collected by simulating the quadrotor in closed loop with a nonlinear controller from [1]. The files Z_all, V_all contain the full trajectories and the full inputs in (z,v)-coordinates, respectively, whereas the files Z_segment, V_segment contain only the T=2.4s segments we used to construct the learned controller. We will be updating this repository to include the simulations and code that was used for the work: "Watch and Learn: Learning to control feedback linearizable systems from expert demonstrations."
